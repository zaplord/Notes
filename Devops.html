Waterfall is a sequential, linear approach to software development. Each phase must be 100% complete before the next one begins, much like building a house where you can't put up walls before the foundation is set.


The Phases (in correct order):


    Requirements Gathering & Analysis: Document every single feature and detail the customer wants. This becomes the fixed contract.


    System Design: Architects and designers create the technical blueprints and specifications based on the requirements.


    Implementation (Development): Programmers write the code according to the design documents.


    Testing: Quality Assurance testers check the complete product for bugs against the initial requirements.


    Deployment: The finished product is delivered and installed for the customer to use.


    Maintenance: After delivery, bugs are fixed and small updates might be made.


  The Major Downsides:


    Inflexibility: It's extremely difficult and expensive to go back and change something. If a requirement changes during development, the process often has to start over.


    Late Delivery & Feedback: The customer doesn't see the working product until the very end. By then, their needs or the market may have changed, making the product less valuable.


    High Risk: The entire project's success hinges on perfect initial planning, which is almost impossible. Any misunderstanding in the requirements leads to a product nobody wants.


    "Big Bang" Launch: Everything is delivered at once, which can be overwhelming for users and risky for the development team.

2. Agile Methodologies: An Adaptive Journey

Agile is a mindset and a set of values focused on flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Instead of a single rigid blueprint, it's like building a product through a series of small,
iterative cycles, constantly adjusting the direction based on feedback.

Core Agile Principles (The "Why"):

    Iterative and Incremental: Work is done in small, time-boxed cycles (called Sprints or iterations), usually 1-4 weeks long. Each cycle produces a small, working piece of the software.

    Customer Collaboration: The customer (or product representative) is involved throughout the process, providing constant feedback instead of just at the beginning and end.

    Responding to Change: Agile processes are built to welcome changing requirements, even late in development. The plan is adaptable.

    Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress: The goal is to produce a tangible, shippable piece of software at the end of every cycle.

How to Do Agile: The Sprint Cycle

The most popular framework for implementing Agile is Scrum. Here’s how a typical Sprint works:

    Product Backlog: This is the master, prioritized to-do list for the entire project. It's maintained by the Product Owner who represents the customer's interests.

    Sprint Planning (Plan): The team selects a chunk of work from the top of the Product Backlog that they can complete in the upcoming sprint. This becomes the Sprint Backlog.

    Daily Stand-up (Design/Build): A super-short (15-minute) daily meeting for the team to sync up: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any obstacles?

    The Sprint (Design/Build/Test): The team works to complete the tasks in the Sprint Backlog. Design, coding, and testing happen continuously throughout the sprint—not as separate phases.

    Sprint Review (Review/Launch): At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the working increment of software to the product owner and stakeholders to get feedback.

    Sprint Retrospective (Learn Fast): The team meets to discuss what went well in the sprint, what could be improved, and how to adapt their process for the next sprint. This is key to continuous improvement.

    The cycle then repeats, continuously delivering value and adapting to change.</pre> </details>
